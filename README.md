# CRRT Prescription Parameters Calculator

This Python script calculates Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) prescription parameters based on patient-specific factors such as weight, urine output, serum creatinine levels, and desired treatment goals (e.g., fluid removal rate, solute clearance).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `crrt_calculator.py` file.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory containing `crrt_calculator.py`.

4. Run the script using the following command:

    ```
    python crrt_calculator.py
    ```

5. Follow the prompts to enter patient-specific information:

    - Patient weight (in kilograms)
    - Patient urine output (in milliliters per hour)
    - Patient serum creatinine level (in milligrams per deciliter)
    - Desired fluid removal rate (in milliliters per hour)
    - Desired solute clearance (in milliliters per minute)

6. The script will calculate and display the CRRT prescription parameters:

    - Blood Flow Rate (Qb) in milliliters per minute
    - Dialysate Flow Rate (Qd) in milliliters per hour
    - Ultrafiltration Rate (Quf) in milliliters per hour
    - Solute Clearance Rate in milliliters per minute

## Example

```
CRRT Prescription Parameters:
Blood Flow Rate (Qb): 350 ml/min
Dialysate Flow Rate (Qd): 2000 ml/hr
Ultrafiltration Rate (Quf): 2000 ml/hr
Solute Clearance Rate: 20 ml/min
```

## Notes

- The formulas used for calculation are placeholders and should be adjusted according to clinical guidelines and best practices.
- Input validation and error handling should be added for a production-ready application.
